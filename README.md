# cards
A boring card library, written (initially) in C.  Now comes in Swift, C++, and Rust.

## Why?
Because I was bored.

## What does it do?
It's a set of playing cards.  You can build a game out of it.

## Is it tested?
Hahahahahahaha

## Can I make changes?
Sure, make a pull request.  Add new languages.  It'll be fun.

## Why is it boring?
Because, it's not that interesting.

## Really?
Yeah.

## Requirements?
* C: Not much, just a C compiler that supports C11.
* C++: I use clang++.  You can use any compiler you want that supports C++11, I guess.
* Swift: Swift 3 compiler on macOS or Linux.
* Rust: The Rust compiler

## How do I build it?
For C / C++:

    cd c
    make

For Swift:

    cd swift
    swift build

For Rust:

    cd rust
    cargo build

## License?
MIT, because you can do whatever you want.
